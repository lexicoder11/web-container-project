Containerized Static Website with CI/CD on AWS
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website using Amazon S3 and AWS Amplify and integrate it with a containerized service using Docker and AWS Fargate. The setup includes CI/CD pipelines for automated deploymet and management.

Architecture
Amazon S3: Hosts the static website.
AWS Amplify: Manages the CI/CD pipeline and provides additional integrations.
Docker: Containerizes the service.
AWS Fargate: Runs the Docker containerized service.
Amazon ECS: Manages the containerized service in the cluster.
Amazon ECR: Stores the Docker images for the service.
Prerequisites
AWS account
Basic knowledge of AWS services
Docker installed
AWS CLI installed
GitHub repository (for CI/CD integration)
Project Setup
Step 1: Prepare Your Static Website
Create Static Website Files:

index.html
style.css
Upload Files to Amazon S3:

Log in to AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon S3.
Create a New S3 Bucket:
Click “Create bucket” and follow the prompts to create a bucket (e.g., my-static-website-bucket).
Upload Static Website Files:
Go to the created bucket, click “Upload,” and upload your index.html and style.css files.
Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting:
Go to the bucket’s Properties tab.
Scroll to the Static website hosting section and enable it.
Specify index.html as the index document and error.html if applicable.
Step 2: Deploy Using AWS Amplify (Optional)
Log in to AWS Amplify Console:

Navigate to the AWS Amplify Console.
Create a New Amplify App:

Click on "Get Started" under "Deploy."
Connect your GitHub repository or configure a build from S3 (if integrating with Amplify).
Configure Build Settings:

AWS Amplify will auto-detect build settings for static sites. Review and save settings.
Deploy Your Website:

Amplify will automatically deploy your static website. Monitor the deployment process.
Step 3: Containerize Your Service Using Docker
Create a Dockerfile:

Write a Dockerfile for your service. For example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy static content to the container
COPY ./html /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run the service
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Build the Docker Image:

Run the following command to build your Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-web-service .
Push the Docker Image to Amazon ECR:

Create an ECR Repository:
In the AWS Management Console, go to Amazon ECR and create a new repository (e.g., my-web-service).
Authenticate Docker to ECR:
bash
Copy code
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
Tag and Push the Docker Image:
bash
Copy code
docker tag my-web-service:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-web-service:latest
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-web-service:latest
Step 4: Deploy Containerized Service Using AWS Fargate
Create an ECS Cluster:

Navigate to Amazon ECS.
Click on “Create Cluster” and select “Networking only” (Fargate).
Create a Task Definition:

Go to “Task Definitions” and click “Create new Task Definition.”
Choose “Fargate” as the launch type.
Specify the Docker image URI from ECR.
Create a Service:

In your ECS cluster, go to the “Services” tab.
Click “Create” and configure your service to use the task definition you created.
Deploy the Service:

ECS will manage the deployment of your containerized service.
Step 5: Integrate AWS Amplify with Your ECS Service
Update Environment Variables:

In AWS Amplify, go to Environment variables.
Add any necessary environment variables required by your ECS service.
Configure Custom Domains (if needed):

Go to Domain management in Amplify.
Set up DNS records to point to your ECS service or use a load balancer.
Update Build Settings (if needed):

Update the amplify.yml file in your Amplify app to include any required build commands or scripts.
Step 6: Test and Monitor
Push Changes to GitHub:

Make changes to your static site or containerized service and push them to your GitHub repository.
Monitor Deployments:

Check AWS Amplify and ECS for deployment statuses and logs.
Troubleshoot Issues:

Use CloudWatch logs to diagnose and troubleshoot any issues with the integrations.
Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of Amazon S3 for static site hosting with Docker containerization and AWS Fargate for running containerized services, demonstrating a complete CI/CD workflow in AWS.
